## Conclusion

I had a great time working with everyone at libcamera. I would like to specially thank my mentors, Laurent Pinchart and Paul ELder for their constant support and motivation. I'd also like to thank Kieren Bingham for guiding me during the last phase of the project. It was indeed a most important and challenging project. I learned a lot during this journey, from writing good quality code to techniques for debugging code at low level. I appreciate the fact that mistakes made by me were returned with concise criticism rather than being reprimanded for them. I will continue to work on this project further and continue being a part of the libcamera community.
